Growing Stronger 
to Care Better
CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT
Shri Mukesh D. Ambani
Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries
Adoption of concepts like circularity 
in our chemical products also brings 
us closer to a low carbon economy. 
We have partnered with accomplished 
innovator entities globally, with 
whom we share the common goal 
of establishing a sustainable world 
economy. We are leveraging their 
expertise to derive maximum value for 
our new energy initiatives. We recognise 
the urgency of addressing the issues 
emanating from climate change. We 
believe our new energy initiatives will 
contribute to the global effort of limiting 
the rise in average temperatures. 
It is important for us to ensure the 
wellbeing of our employees and 
communities. We lay great emphasis on 
the health, safety and development of 
all our employees, customers, business 
partners and local communities. 
Human rights considerations have 
been at the core of Reliance’s DNA 
since inception. The principles of 
human rights are enshrined in our 
internal codes of conduct as well as our 
business partner codes of conduct. Our 
Reliance Foundation works round the 
clock driving initiatives in education, 
healthcare and social development 
that have impacted millions of lives 
over the years. Abiding by our principle 
of inclusive growth, our teams across 
businesses work at a grass root 
level to identify the needs of every 
stakeholder involved and commit to 
securing their interests and maintaining 
their satisfaction.
Managing large and diverse 
businesses is not possible without a 
robust governance structure. We, as 
a company, have always strived 
to maintain the highest levels of 
governance in our management. 
We emphasise the importance of 
Board oversight, given the fact that 
the company’s diverse and evolving 
operations impact essential sectors 
of the Indian economy. The Board 
Committees at Reliance have clearly 
defined roles and mandates. We are 
committed to adhering to the best 
practices and to adapting to emerging 
standards of governance. 
Pursuing the path of good governance, 
we constituted the ESG committee 
to ensure our continued alignment to 
best ESG practices and compliance 
with applicable ESG frameworks. The 
committee will advise the board and 
other committees on environmental, 
social and governance aspects involved 
in the conduct of business activities.
We have entered an era of 
transformation – transformation to a 
greener and a more inclusive economy. 
Our businesses, our people and our 
practices are evolving and adapting to 
the new age with a renewed zest. Our 
newest growth engine, our new energy 
business is poised to become a pioneer 
and lead the way towards just global 
energy transition. 
Creation of an Independent 
Financial Services Business
My dear friends, as you are aware 
that this year we have demerged our 
financial services arm into a separate 
listed entity named “Jio Financial 
Services Limited” (JFS). I thank you 
for your wholehearted support to 
this initiative.
Today’s India is young and 
entrepreneurial, adopting digital 
finance at an unprecedented pace. The 
digital revolution has penetrated every 
corner of the nation through Jandhan

Financial Performance 
Summary for the Year
There was continued volatility in the 
global markets amidst disruptions in 
trade flows and economic uncertainties. 
Despite the headwinds, Reliance 
was able to deliver another year 
of remarkable performance both 
on operating and financial fronts. 
Consolidated EBITDA was at `1,53,920 
crore which is a robust 24.4% growth as 
compared to last year. Consolidated net 
profit also grew at 11.3% to `73,670 crore.
The impressive growth was well rounded 
and supported by all our business 
segments. Consumer businesses 
continued their growth trajectory with 
a rapid expansion of retail store footprint 
and strong subscriber acquisition 
in Jio. O2C business delivered a record 
performance amidst a challenging 
business environment. 
A switch to cleaner energy 
sources is key to our 
decarbonisation strategy. 
We are making significant 
strides in establishing a 
world class solar energy 
value chain. We are also 
progressing on building a 
green hydrogen ecosystem. 
Our goal is to provide 
affordable green hydrogen 
as a viable alternative to 
traditional fuels.
Our goal is to become Net Carbon Zero 
by 2035. Accordingly, the development 
of giga factories at the Dhirubhai 
Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex 
at Jamnagar is progressing rapidly. 
Considering the collective potential 
of our five giga factories, we are well 
on track for establishing a world class, 
self‑sufficient green energy ecosystem. 
The transition from traditional fossil 
fuels to renewable energy sources 
is going to be a crucial milestone in 
our history. We, as a company, have 
a proven record of creating value 
through transformational changes, be 
it the digital revolution through Jio, 
transforming consumer experience 
and the retail landscape in India or 
the integration of our refining and 
petrochemicals businesses into the oil 
to chemicals value chain.

Dear and esteemed 
fellow shareholders,
We, at Reliance, have a 
deep-rooted belief that 
sustainability is an integral 
part of enterprise growth. 
The tremendous stress that 
mankind has exerted on 
natural resources, since the 
advent of the Industrial 
Revolution, has brought 
us to a stage where we 
need to collectively ramp 
up our efforts to combat 
climate change. 
The Paris Agreement of 
2015 entered into at the 
21st Conference of Parties 
(COP 21) brought the world 
together in this pursuit.  
Our company’s ESG 
ambitions are aligned 
with this global quest. On 
a personal note, it is a 
privilege for me to serve on 
the Advisory Committee of 
COP 28 UAE, and contribute 
to this ongoing effort.

CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT
Shri Mukesh D. Ambani
Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries
Adoption of concepts like circularity 
in our chemical products also brings 
us closer to a low carbon economy. 
We have partnered with accomplished 
innovator entities globally, with 
whom we share the common goal 
of establishing a sustainable world 
economy. We are leveraging their 
expertise to derive maximum value for 
our new energy initiatives. We recognise 
the urgency of addressing the issues 
emanating from climate change. We 
believe our new energy initiatives will 
contribute to the global effort of limiting 
the rise in average temperatures. 
It is important for us to ensure the 
wellbeing of our employees and 
communities. We lay great emphasis on 
the health, safety and development of 
all our employees, customers, business 
partners and local communities. 
Human rights considerations have 
been at the core of Reliance’s DNA 
since inception. The principles of 
human rights are enshrined in our 
internal codes of conduct as well as our 
business partner codes of conduct. Our 
Reliance Foundation works round the 
clock driving initiatives in education, 
healthcare and social development 
that have impacted millions of lives 
over the years. Abiding by our principle 
of inclusive growth, our teams across 
businesses work at a grass root 
level to identify the needs of every 
stakeholder involved and commit to 
securing their interests and maintaining 
their satisfaction.
Managing large and diverse 
businesses is not possible without a 
robust governance structure. We, as 
a company, have always strived 
to maintain the highest levels of 
governance in our management. 
We emphasise the importance of 
Board oversight, given the fact that 
the company’s diverse and evolving 
operations impact essential sectors 
of the Indian economy. The Board 
Committees at Reliance have clearly 
defined roles and mandates. We are 
committed to adhering to the best 
practices and to adapting to emerging 
standards of governance. 
Pursuing the path of good governance, 
we constituted the ESG committee 
to ensure our continued alignment to 
best ESG practices and compliance 
with applicable ESG frameworks. The 
committee will advise the board and 
other committees on environmental, 
social and governance aspects involved 
in the conduct of business activities.
We have entered an era of 
transformation – transformation to a 
greener and a more inclusive economy. 
Our businesses, our people and our 
practices are evolving and adapting to 
the new age with a renewed zest. Our 
newest growth engine, our new energy 
business is poised to become a pioneer 
and lead the way towards just global 
energy transition. 
Creation of an Independent 
Financial Services Business
My dear friends, as you are aware 
that this year we have demerged our 
financial services arm into a separate 
listed entity named “Jio Financial 
Services Limited” (JFS). I thank you 
for your wholehearted support to 
this initiative.
Today’s India is young and 
entrepreneurial, adopting digital 
finance at an unprecedented pace. The 
digital revolution has penetrated every 
corner of the nation through Jandhan 
Accounts, digital payments, usage of 
smart phones and low cost data. The 
growth opportunities presented by 
financial services are remarkable and 
provide a strong directional support to 
the economy. 
As various financial services are governed 
by different regulatory frameworks, 
we believe, an independent financial 
services entity will allow us to access 
the opportunities available in the 
Indian market. 
Jio Financial Services Limited along 
with its subsidiaries will leverage the

by 2035. Accordingly, the development 
of giga factories at the Dhirubhai 
Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex 
at Jamnagar is progressing rapidly. 
Considering the collective potential 
of our five giga factories, we are well 
on track for establishing a world class, 
self‑sufficient green energy ecosystem. 
The transition from traditional fossil 
fuels to renewable energy sources 
is going to be a crucial milestone in 
our history. We, as a company, have 
a proven record of creating value 
through transformational changes, be 
it the digital revolution through Jio, 
transforming consumer experience 
and the retail landscape in India or 
the integration of our refining and 
petrochemicals businesses into the oil 
to chemicals value chain.

Dear and esteemed 
fellow shareholders,
We, at Reliance, have a 
deep-rooted belief that 
sustainability is an integral 
part of enterprise growth. 
The tremendous stress that 
mankind has exerted on 
natural resources, since the 
advent of the Industrial 
Revolution, has brought 
us to a stage where we 
need to collectively ramp 
up our efforts to combat 
climate change. 
The Paris Agreement of 
2015 entered into at the 
21st Conference of Parties 
(COP 21) brought the world 
together in this pursuit.  
Our company’s ESG 
ambitions are aligned 
with this global quest. On 
a personal note, it is a 
privilege for me to serve on 
the Advisory Committee of 
COP 28 UAE, and contribute 
to this ongoing effort.

### Context Before Table:
CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT
Oil and gas segment also registered 
a strong performance with sustained 
gas production from KG D6 block.
Elevated inflation levels led to an 
aggressive rate hike by central banks 
through the financial year. Our 
prudent financial framework helped 
optimise the returns and minimise 
the risks while providing adequate 
liquidity to our businesses. Our strong 
cash flows from operations have ably 
supported growth capex requirements. 
Over the past 2 years, 98% of the 
company’s capex has been funded by 
internally generated cash profits. This 
has helped us maintain a strong and 
conservative balance sheet and retain 
superior investment grade ratings. 	
Robust Operational 
Performance
Reliance touches the lives of 
millions of consumers in India and 
worldwide through its energy and 
consumer businesses. Our teams 
across businesses work dedicatedly 
to achieve operational excellence and 
deliver quality performance.
Premier League on Jio Cinema. Jio 
Platforms powered the technology 
behind streaming these events. The 
new home broadband back up plan is 
the latest addition to the bouquet of 
broadband services and is expected to 
grow the broadband market further. 
Jio retained its preeminent position 
in the Indian telecom space with 
439.3 million subscribers as on 
March 2023, with a net addition of 
29.2 million subscribers during the 
year. The strong growth in the digital 
services business is aptly reflected in 
its financial performance for the year. 
With an increase of 24.9% from the 
previous year, digital services EBITDA 
for FY 2022-23 stood at `50,286 crore. 
Jio commits itself to continually 
innovate and launch newer 
technologies and products and 
expand the market for digital services. 
Jio True 5G stack is one such feature 
loaded indigenous technology, 
offering superior performance. It is 
secure, cost effective and also easy to 
install. This technology is fully cloud 
native, software defined, digitally 
managed and supports advanced 
features like Quantum Security. 
Jio AirFiber is also an innovative 
solution, offering clutter free and 
high speed connectivity to users with 
the capability of supporting multiple 
devices simultaneously without 
compromising on the quality of 
connectivity. JioDive is a technology 
that helps users to explore the virtual 
reality universe through a smartphone 
based headset. JioDive runs on the 
JioImmerse application which offers 
users exclusive VR experiences in 
gaming, learning, entertainment 
and wellness, all accessible through 
their smartphone.
I believe Jio’s digital offerings have 
established it as a strong market 
leader in India’s digital services 
ecosystem. The scale of Jio’s 
operation and advantages of deep 
penetration help Jio grow stronger 
with the launch of each new offering. 
Jio’s vision is to make the highest level 
of connectivity available to the masses 
at affordable prices at all times. 
Retail 
Reliance Retail further consolidated 
its position as the largest retailer 
in India and the only Indian retailer

globally. FY 2022-23 witnessed 
Reliance Retail cross the 1 billion

space as compared to the previous 
year. Footfalls increased by 50% 
from last year to 780 million. The 
registered customer base also grew 
to 249 million, establishing Reliance 
Retail as the preferred shopping venue 
of Indian citizen across formats.
During the year, Reliance Retail 
entered into the beauty segment by 
launching the “Tira” digital platform 
and opening its flagship store in 
Mumbai. The business also expanded 
its product basket through acquisitions 
and partnerships at both local and 
global levels like Metro, Campa Cola, 
GAP, Pret A Manger, Lotus, Sosyo, 
Maliban, Toffeeman to name a few.
Reliance Retails runs an integrated 
network of physical stores, digital 
commerce and new commerce 
initiatives. Through digital brands like 
Ajio and Netmeds, digital commerce 
is scaling up at a rapid pace and is 
contributing to the strong growth of 
retail segment. The launch of JioMart 
on WhatsApp is a truly novel initiative 
which combines online shopping 
experience with the simplicity of 
instant chat services. Growth in 
new commerce business has been 
fast paced with rapid expansion 
of its merchant partner network. 
Currently, more than 3 million

44.7% increase from the previous

CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT
Oil and gas segment also registered 
a strong performance with sustained 
gas production from KG D6 block.
Elevated inflation levels led to an 
aggressive rate hike by central banks 
through the financial year. Our 
prudent financial framework helped 
optimise the returns and minimise 
the risks while providing adequate 
liquidity to our businesses. Our strong 
cash flows from operations have ably 
supported growth capex requirements. 
Over the past 2 years, 98% of the 
company’s capex has been funded by 
internally generated cash profits. This 
has helped us maintain a strong and 
conservative balance sheet and retain 
superior investment grade ratings. 	
Robust Operational 
Performance
Reliance touches the lives of 
millions of consumers in India and 
worldwide through its energy and 
consumer businesses. Our teams 
across businesses work dedicatedly

Digital Services
Digital services continued its 
strong performance through the 
strengthening of existing offerings 
and introducing newer services in 
its portfolio. During the year, Jio 
launched the True 5G services in India. 
By the end of the financial year, Jio’s 
5G coverage expanded to 2,300+ 
cities and towns, demonstrating 
an impressive pace of network 
installation. The rollout of FTTH 
services also gained momentum 
during the year. 
Millions of viewers enjoyed the live

and the 16th edition of the Indian 
Oil to Chemicals
Despite facing major operational 
challenges given the highly volatile 
global scenarios, our O2C business 
posted highest ever earnings 
excluding the impact of SAED. 
Revenues increased on account 
of improved price realisation for 
transportation fuel, tracking higher 
average oil prices for the year. O2C 
business EBITDA stood at `62,075 
crore with a healthy 17.7% increase 
as compared to last year despite 
considering the SAED levy of 
`6,648 crore. EBITDA growth was 
driven by feedstock flexibility, sharp 
improvements in fuel cracks and 
advantageous ethane cracking. 
During the year, our refinery 
processed 13 new variants of crude 
oil, broadening the feedstock sources. 
Demand for transportation fuels 
was strong for the year reflecting 
the opening up of economies post 
pandemic restrictions. Demand for 
downstream chemical products 
remained subdued globally, but was 
strong in the domestic markets. 
Oil and Gas Exploration 
and Production  
Performance of the exploration 
and production segment was 
noteworthy for the year. The 
revenue more than doubled and the 
EBITDA was 2.5x the previous year 
number at `13,589 crore. The growth 
in EBITDA was primarily on account 
of improved gas price realisation and 
higher gas production in the KG D6 
block. Domestic production was, in 
fact, at a 10-year high. I am proud to 
share that we have an exceptional 
record of safety in our upstream 
business with another year 100% 
incident free operations.

### Context Before Table:
CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT
Oil and gas segment also registered 
a strong performance with sustained 
gas production from KG D6 block.
Elevated inflation levels led to an 
aggressive rate hike by central banks 
through the financial year. Our 
prudent financial framework helped 
optimise the returns and minimise 
the risks while providing adequate 
liquidity to our businesses. Our strong 
cash flows from operations have ably 
supported growth capex requirements. 
Over the past 2 years, 98% of the 
company’s capex has been funded by 
internally generated cash profits. This 
has helped us maintain a strong and 
conservative balance sheet and retain 
superior investment grade ratings. 	
Robust Operational 
Performance
Reliance touches the lives of 
millions of consumers in India and 
worldwide through its energy and 
consumer businesses. Our teams 
across businesses work dedicatedly 
to achieve operational excellence and 
deliver quality performance.
Premier League on Jio Cinema. Jio 
Platforms powered the technology 
behind streaming these events. The 
new home broadband back up plan is 
the latest addition to the bouquet of 
broadband services and is expected to 
grow the broadband market further. 
Jio retained its preeminent position 
in the Indian telecom space with 
439.3 million subscribers as on 
March 2023, with a net addition of 
29.2 million subscribers during the 
year. The strong growth in the digital 
services business is aptly reflected in 
its financial performance for the year. 
With an increase of 24.9% from the 
previous year, digital services EBITDA 
for FY 2022-23 stood at `50,286 crore. 
Jio commits itself to continually 
innovate and launch newer 
technologies and products and 
expand the market for digital services. 
Jio True 5G stack is one such feature 
loaded indigenous technology, 
offering superior performance. It is 
secure, cost effective and also easy to 
install. This technology is fully cloud 
native, software defined, digitally 
managed and supports advanced 
features like Quantum Security. 
Jio AirFiber is also an innovative 
solution, offering clutter free and 
high speed connectivity to users with 
the capability of supporting multiple 
devices simultaneously without 
compromising on the quality of 
connectivity. JioDive is a technology 
that helps users to explore the virtual 
reality universe through a smartphone 
based headset. JioDive runs on the 
JioImmerse application which offers 
users exclusive VR experiences in 
gaming, learning, entertainment 
and wellness, all accessible through 
their smartphone.
I believe Jio’s digital offerings have 
established it as a strong market 
leader in India’s digital services 
ecosystem. The scale of Jio’s 
operation and advantages of deep 
penetration help Jio grow stronger 
with the launch of each new offering. 
Jio’s vision is to make the highest level 
of connectivity available to the masses 
at affordable prices at all times. 
Retail 
Reliance Retail further consolidated 
its position as the largest retailer 
in India and the only Indian retailer 
to feature in the top 100 retailers 
globally. FY 2022-23 witnessed 
Reliance Retail cross the 1 billion 
transactions mark.
The retail business expanded its 
store network with over 3,300 new 
stores added during the financial year, 
taking the store tally to 18,040 stores 
Pan-India. Our stores now cover 
65.6 million sq ft of store area which 
is a more than 50% growth of retail 
space as compared to the previous 
year. Footfalls increased by 50% 
from last year to 780 million. The 
registered customer base also grew 
to 249 million, establishing Reliance 
Retail as the preferred shopping venue 
of Indian citizen across formats.

### Context After Table:
to make best in class products 
available to the Indian consumers at 
affordable prices.
During the year our teams across sites 
worked towards finding sustainable 
solutions. The first ever green 
hydrogen production was achieved 
with firing of torrefied biomass in 
gasifiers. Biomass firing in Coal Fired 
Boilers (CFBs) at petrochemical 
sites increased to >11% of total feed 
in line with our decarbonisation 
efforts. Ethanol blending in motor 
spirit (EBMS) facility was also 
commissioned. We also successfully 
commissioned the demo plant for 
our patented Continuous Catalytic 
Pyrolysis oil technology. 
Our O2C business is transforming. 
From switch to renewable sources 
of energy and newer energy 
technologies to promoting the 
concept of circular economy especially 
for our petrochemical products, 
sustainable business techniques are 
rapidly gaining momentum.
MJ field at the KG D6 Block 
commenced production post testing 
and commissioning activities. At 
peak production of ~30 MMSCMD, 
KG D6 block will contribute ~30% 
of the domestic gas production. 
Operationalization of the KG D6 MJ gas 
field is a crucial step towards enhancing 
India’s energy security. 
Conclusion
Dear fellow shareholders, Reliance, 
as a company has grown multifold by 
delivering value to the citizens, the 
country and global community. Our 
products are ingrained in the lives of the 
citizens and are an integral part of their 
daily routines. Our various businesses 
have always identified the needs of the 
society and worked towards devising 
and making available timely and 
affordable solutions. 
The current needs of the society are 
sustainable solutions which can tackle 
climate change through affordable 
green energy and inclusive growth. Our 
initiatives in New Energy businesses and 
our consumer businesses are aimed at 
meeting societal needs and aspirations. 
Using the right technology, deploying 
the right talent and through empowering 
our young leaders, I am confident that 
we can make the world a better place to 
live in for future generations. 
I would like to express my sincere 
appreciation to the Board of Directors 
for their continued guidance. I would 
like to thank our teams across 
businesses, for their dedicated work 
and commitment to excellence. I would 
also like to extend my gratitude to all 
our stakeholders for their support and 
unwavering faith in Reliance.
With best wishes,
Mukesh D. Ambani

Digital Services
Digital services continued its 
strong performance through the 
strengthening of existing offerings 
and introducing newer services in 
its portfolio. During the year, Jio 
launched the True 5G services in India. 
By the end of the financial year, Jio’s 
5G coverage expanded to 2,300+ 
cities and towns, demonstrating 
an impressive pace of network 
installation. The rollout of FTTH 
services also gained momentum 
during the year. 
Millions of viewers enjoyed the live 
action of the FIFA World Cup, the 
first ever Women’s Premier League 
and the 16th edition of the Indian 
Oil to Chemicals
Despite facing major operational 
challenges given the highly volatile 
global scenarios, our O2C business 
posted highest ever earnings 
excluding the impact of SAED. 
Revenues increased on account 
of improved price realisation for 
transportation fuel, tracking higher 
average oil prices for the year. O2C 
business EBITDA stood at `62,075 
crore with a healthy 17.7% increase 
as compared to last year despite 
considering the SAED levy of 
`6,648 crore. EBITDA growth was 
driven by feedstock flexibility, sharp 
improvements in fuel cracks and 
advantageous ethane cracking. 
During the year, our refinery 
processed 13 new variants of crude 
oil, broadening the feedstock sources. 
Demand for transportation fuels 
was strong for the year reflecting 
the opening up of economies post 
pandemic restrictions. Demand for 
downstream chemical products 
remained subdued globally, but was 
strong in the domestic markets. 
Oil and Gas Exploration 
and Production  
Performance of the exploration 
and production segment was 
noteworthy for the year. The 
revenue more than doubled and the 
EBITDA was 2.5x the previous year 
number at `13,589 crore. The growth 
in EBITDA was primarily on account 
of improved gas price realisation and 
higher gas production in the KG D6 
block. Domestic production was, in 
fact, at a 10-year high. I am proud to 
share that we have an exceptional 
record of safety in our upstream 
business with another year 100% 
incident free operations.

The report contains forward-looking statements, identified by words like ‘plans’, ‘expects’, ‘will’, ‘anticipates’, ‘believes’, 
‘intends’, ‘projects’, ‘estimates’ and so on. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, but 
not limited to the Company’s strategy for growth, product development, market position, expenditures, and financial

and Review
China. China growth is expected to 
rebound to 5.2% in CY23 from 3% 
on reopening of the economy after 
three years and continued monetary 
policy support. India is expected to 
remain amongst the fastest growing 
economies as per IMF.
Indian Economy
The Indian economy remained 
relatively stable amidst the global 
imbalances caused by the Russia- 
Ukraine conflict. The economy grew 
at 7.2% in FY 2022-23, down from 
9.1% in FY 2021-22, as per the National 
Statistical Office data release. 
The spike in global commodity prices 
pushed up prices in India too, with 
retail inflation peaking at 7.79% in April 
2022, above the medium-term target 
band of 2%-6% of the RBI. The RBI 
took stringent measures to combat 
the rising prices, hiking repo rate six 
times in FY 2022-23, from 4% at the 
beginning of May 2022 to 6.5% at 
the close of the financial year. Private

beginning of May 2022 to 6.5% at 
the close of the financial year. Private 
consumption, however, witnessed 
a strong surge fuelling a boost in 
production across sectors. Domestic 
sector services activity remained 
resilient with average Services PMI 
higher at 57.5 in FY23 vs 52.2 in 
FY22. Manufacturing too remained 
robust with average manufacturing 
PMI higher at 55.8 in FY23 vs 54.1 in 
FY22. Credit growth gained traction 
with year-on-year growth of 15% (as 
of March ’23) while deposit growth 
lagged with year-on-year growth of 
9.6%, leading to a rise in incremental 
credit-deposit ratio.
India overtook Japan and Germany 
to become the third largest 
automobile market in terms sales in 
December 2022. India also emerged 
as the second largest mobile phone 
manufacturer globally. India’s digital

impressive run in FY 2022-23, with 
transaction volumes almost doubling 
from ~45 billion in FY 2021-22 to ~84 
billion in FY 2022-23, while transaction 
value also surged to ~139 lakh crore 
in FY 2022-23 from ~84 lakh crore in 
FY 2021-22. The pan- India monthly 
mobile data traffic stood at 14.4 
Exabyte in 2022 with 3.2x growth 
over last five years. Rapid digitisation 
supported by solid infrastructure is 
driving efficiency and productivity in 
the economy. India’s external sector 
continued to gain strength as FY23 
merchandise exports grew to $447 
billion, growing at 6% Y-o-Y and 
services exports grew to $322 billion, 
growing at 27% Y-o-Y.

and falling commodity prices coupled 
with softening domestic demand are 
likely to moderate inflation to 5.1% 
in the current financial year. With 
a growing working age population, 
a large domestic market, boost to 
infrastructure development and 
advent of digitisation, India is well 
positioned to be the fastest growing 
large economy in the world. India GDP 
is expected to grow at 6.5% in FY24.
Performance Overview
Reliance delivered strong annual 
performance amid macro headwinds 
caused by geo-political conflicts, 
disruptions in commodity trade 
flows and economic downturn. 
Resilience of Reliance’s strategic and 
operational capabilities reflected 
in its ability to adapt to dynamic 
business environments and navigate 
through complex business situations. 
Growth was supported by agile and 
efficient operations by all business 
teams with sound strategic planning 
and implementation.

was supported by agile and 
efficient operations by all business 
teams with sound strategic planning 
and implementation.
Earnings growth was led by rebound 
in O2C business, backed by healthy 
domestic demand, strong fuel 
margins and high utilisation rates. 
Oil and gas segment performance 
reflected volume growth in KG D6 
gas production, higher gas price 
realisations and margin improvements. 
Operational efficiencies continued 
with 100% uptime.
Fiscal prudence and proactive risk management formed the guide rails for 
navigating a challenging macro environment. Despite synchronised raising of 
policy rates by Central Banks and volatility in commodity prices, we contained the 
rise in finance costs while ensuring the Balance Sheet has strength and liquidity to 
support growth initiatives.

Global Economy
Global economy grew 3.4% in CY22, 
slowing from the post-COVID rebound 
of 6.2% in CY21. Growth was in-line 
with pre-pandemic average (2015-
19) of 3.4% despite Russia-Ukraine 
conflict and aggressive rate hikes by 
central banks. Advanced economies 
(AEs) saw above-trend growth of 
2.7% in CY22, higher than the 2.1% 
average seen in the five years prior 
to the pandemic. This was led by 
strong growth in both US and Euro 
area which grew at 2.1% % and 3.5% 
respectively. Inflationary pressures 
remained near multi-decade highs 
in AEs, with US inflation averaging 
8% Y-o-Y (highest since 1980s), while 
Euro area inflation also averaged a 
multi-decade high of 8.4%. Developed 
market central banks aggressively 
tightened their monetary policy to 
address inflation, with US Federal 
Reserve raising rates by 450bps in 
CY22, while European Central Bank 
hiked rates by 250 bps. Emerging

CY22, while European Central Bank 
hiked rates by 250 bps. Emerging 
Market and Developing Economies 
(EMDEs) grew 4% in CY22, below the 
pre-pandemic average of 4.4% due 
to slowdown in Chinese economy 
amidst frequent lockdowns. China 
growth eased to 3%, well below the 
pre-pandemic average of 6.7% on 
continued zero-COVID policy and 
housing downturn. Crude oil prices 
were elevated during FY 2023, 
averaging $93/bbl, remaining above 
$100/bbl in first half of the fiscal 
year due to Russia-Ukraine conflict, 
but receding in the second half with 
Chinese demand slowing and release 
of strategic petroleum reserves from 
OECD countries.
Global growth is expected to slow in 
CY23 to 2.8% as the lagged impact 
of synchronised global monetary 
tightening. Growth in advanced

## Content Block 88
### Context Before Table:
Consumer business segments 
continued to strengthen their 
positions in the market with 
aggressive expansion of footprint and 
strategically prudent acquisitions. Jio 
successfully launched True 5G services 
across over 2,300 towns and cities, 
thereby continuing to offer enhanced 
digital experiences to its subscribers. 
The retail business broadened its 
product and distribution base further, 
making available a vast assortment of 
products and brands to its consumers 
at affordable prices.
Reliance Jio Financial Services is 
demerged. The new entity is expected 
to unlock value for shareholders and 
give them an opportunity to be a part 
of a new growth platform.
The New Energy business is 
making rapid progress with fast 
paced implementation of the 
giga factories at Jamnagar. With 
strategic partnerships and significant 
investments in newer technologies, 
Reliance is well on track for building 
the New Energy business as a strong 
sustainable growth engine and 
achieving the target of becoming 
Net Carbon Zero.

CONSOLIDATED REVENUE IN 
FY 2022-23 ↗ 23.6% Y-O-Y
Revenue 
Reliance attained a consolidated 
revenue of `9,74,864 crore 
($118.6 billion), up 23.6%, as compared 
to `7,88,743 crore in the previous year. 
All operating segments saw growth in 
revenue. O2C revenues increased on 
account of improved price realisation 
for transportation fuels with 19% 
increase in average Brent crude prices. 
Sharp increase in gas price realisation 
coupled with increase in the gas 
production contributed to growth in 
Oil & Gas segment revenues. Retail 
Segment revenue was driven by 
strong broad-based growth across all 
consumption baskets and large‑scale 
store expansion. Digital Services 
revenue was led by full impact 
of tariff hike, ramp-up of wireline 
services and continued subscriber 
addition for mobility services. 
Profit

increased by 24.4% to `1,53,920 
crore ($18.7 billion) as compared 
to `1,23,684 crore in FY 2021‑22. 
Retail business led EBITDA 
growth with 44.7% increase 
mainly due to benefits of scale 
and operating leverage leading 
to margin expansion. Growth in 
Digital Services segment EBITDA 
was 24.9% on account of higher 
revenue and steady improvement 
in margins. O2C EBITDA increased 
by 17.7% with sharp improvement in 
transportation fuel cracks and robust 
demand which was partially offset 
by introduction of SAED on export 
of transportation fuel and lower 
downstream product delta. Oil & Gas 
segment EBITDA increased over 
2.5x with higher gas price realisation. 
Cash Profit increased by 15.4% to 
`1,25,951 crore as compared to

($68.8 billion), an increase of 21.6% 
as compared to `4,65,045 crore in 
the previous year. Revenue growth 
was led by increase in crude and

an increase of 13.4% against 
`37,937 crore in the previous year.

previous year.

### Context Before Table:
Liquidity and Capital 
Resources
Persistent Inflationary pressures 
and globally rising interest rate 
environment were the key underlying 
themes of financial markets in 
FY 2022-23. The year was also marked 
by a sharp depreciation of the Rupee 
against the Dollar. RIL successfully 
managed its Balance Sheet risks 
through the challenging environment 
while ensuring sufficient liquidity for 
business operations.
External Environment
A persistent broadening of inflation 
pressures triggered a rapid and 
synchronised tightening of global 
monetary conditions, alongside strong 
appreciation of the US dollar against 
most other currencies. 
The rising price pressures were 
expected to produce a squeeze on 
real incomes as well as undermine 
macroeconomic stability. This led 
most Central Banks around the world 
to rapidly lift nominal policy rates 
to much above the pre‑pandemic 
levels, both in advanced and 
emerging market economies. The 
US Federal Reserve raised policy 
rates aggressively by 500 bps in past 
fifteen months, the fastest hiking 
cycle since 1980. In Europe, the war-
related intensification of inflationary 
pressures led European Central Bank 
to finally exit its negative interest 
rate regime and ultra-easy monetary 
policy after eight years and raise 
interest rates by 325 bps in past 
nine months. The real activity and 
financial markets responded to the 
removal of monetary accommodation 
with slowing momentum in housing 
market, credit conditions, labour 
markets and PMI surveys. 
In response to progressive rate hikes 
by the Central Banks, the global 
headline inflation started declining in 
the second half of the year. However, 
the decline in inflation print reflects 
the sharp reversal in energy and food 
prices and the core inflation continues 
to remain sticky. Consequently, to 
anchor inflation expectations major 
central banks have signalled the need 
for staying course on a restrictive 
monetary policy stance. 
On the other side, the accelerated 
policy normalisation has brought 
forth vulnerabilities in the US regional 
banks. The risk of contagion across 
the broader financial sector is inducing 
volatility in the financial markets and 
driving market-implied policy path 
on downside. 
RBI too raised rates by a cumulative 
250 bps in the year, in-line with global 
monetary tightening as inflation 
remained persistently above RBI’s 6% 
upper-target band. As the forward 
outlook on inflation moderated 
towards 5-5.5% in the second 
half of the year, RBI guided for a 
conditional pause keeping the policy 
stance focused on withdrawal of 
accommodation. A prolonged pause 
from RBI is expected to progressively 
align headline inflation to its target 
while also supporting growth. 
On the external front, a noticeable 
improvement in India’s current 
account deficit (CAD) on back of 
moderation in oil prices and structural 
strength in India’s services exports, 
is expected to keep CAD benign and 
below 2% of GDP. The outlook on 
capital inflows also looks promising as 
emerging markets growth is expected 
to outperform developed markets. As 
the lagged effect of cumulative hikes 
sets-in, developed markets is expected 
to witness slowdown. In contrast, India 
is expected to emerge as the fastest 
growing economy in FY 2023-24 
with 6.5%, while global growth are 
expected only at 2.8%. Overall, India’s 
growth differential and comfortable 
CAD dynamics are expected to keep 
the Indian Rupee well supported in 
the near to medium-term.
Despite the unprecedented 
macro‑economic uncertainty, the 
Company was successfully able to 
navigate abrupt adjustments in the 
market, maintain adequate liquidity 
on its balance sheet, manage its 
financial market risks and deliver a 
consistent return on its investment 
portfolio by staying invested in low 
risk, liquid instruments. Reliance 
Treasury continued to stay focused on 
providing liquidity to the businesses 
at the optimal risk adjusted cost by 
accessing financing from different 
markets and using appropriate 
instruments and currencies.
Treasury Management and 
Financial Strategy
Reliance’s medium term Financial 
Strategy is guided by a Financial 
Planning process which is integrated 
with individual business plans. RIL 
Treasury’s key objectives include 
raising Long Term financing for capex 
and Short-Term liabilities for financing 
working capital at the most efficient 
rates and also design suitable hedging 
strategies to manage currency 
and interest rate risks on both the 
asset and liability side of company’s

Balance Sheet.
Fund Raising
During FY 2022-23, the Company and 
its subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm 
Limited (RJIL) tied up $3 billion 
equivalent through syndicated 
term loan facilities. The transaction 
was heavily oversubscribed in the 
primary syndication market by global 
lenders across geographies. The 
proceeds from the loans were used 
to meet the capital expenditure 
requirements of both the companies. 
This was a landmark transaction on 
various counts:
a)	
The aggregate liquidity raised 
from primary syndication was 
$3 billion equivalent, one of the 
largest liquidity raised through 
syndication in Asia Pacific 
(APAC).
b)	
55 international lenders across 
all major continents participated 
in the transaction making it the 
largest bank group in a corporate 
loan out of APAC since 2000.
c)	
This is the largest syndicated 
loan from India
RJIL tied up its first ever Swedish 
Export Credit Agency (EKN) 
supported facilities of $2.2 billion 
equivalent making it the largest cover 
ever provided by EKN for a deal to a 
private corporate globally.
The proceeds of the facilities shall be 
utilised to finance the equipment and 
services in relation to RJIL’s pan-India 
5G roll out. 
Liquidity Management
The combination of strong cash 
flows from operations, access to 
unutilised borrowing facilities, and 
robust cash and cash equivalents 
position forms the basis of Reliance 
Industries’ liquidity base. This strong 
liquidity position provides the 
company with financial flexibility, 
enabling it to navigate various 
market conditions, pursue growth 
opportunities, and meet its financial 
obligations effectively.
The operating cycle is closely 
monitored to optimise the working 
capital structure and facilitate 
short term financing. Our proactive 
approach to reviewing trade financing 
solutions and optimising the 
operating cycle demonstrates our 
commitment to robust working capital 
management and effective business 
financing. RIL effectively uses 
Commercial Paper, Working Capital 
Demand Loan and other solutions to 
finance its payables and receivables 
and reduce the cost of funds.
RIL manages its cash and cash 
equivalents through an investment 
portfolio, diversified across 
instruments and counterparties. 
The investments are in highly liquid 
instruments such as government 
bonds, AAA papers, Bank deposits 
and Debt Mutual Funds. The 
investment portfolio is monitored 
under a strong risk management 
framework assuring adherence to 
liquidity objectives. The portfolio 
is calibrated continually to straddle 
between the objectives of capital 
protection, steady returns, and 
provision of adequate liquidity at 
short notice. 
Credit Rating
RILs focussed approach on financial discipline and risk management is reflected in its strong credit rating as it continues 
to be rated two notches above sovereign by S&P and one notch above sovereign by Moody’s.

Senior Unsecured Notes issued in January 2022.
Way Forward
RIL will continue to draw strength from its robust balance sheet and operating cash flows to create value for its shareholders 
in a sustainable manner by investing in new business opportunities. RIL will continue to monitor financial markets for the 
right opportunity to raise capital to support growth plans of existing and new businesses while maintaining a keen focus on 
financial discipline and risk management.

OUTLOOK
The Indian consumption 
trend is poised to remain 
on an upward trajectory 
supported by several long 
term sustainable tailwinds. 
These include a favourable 
demographic profile, 
increasing per capita 
income, rising aspirations 
supported by affordable 
data that has narrowed 
the information gap, and 
improved access to stores 
and e-commerce in rural 
areas that has deepened 
the reach of brands and 
closed the aspirational 
divide between urban and 
rural consumers.
Furthermore, emerging 
organised retail formats, 
digital and technological 
advancements, the 
ongoing trend of 
urbanisation and greater 
access to financing are 
changing the consumption 
landscape. With per 
capita GDP surpassing the 
critical $2,000 threshold, 
consumer discretionary 
spending is likely to 
trend upward, and these 
trends together suggest a 
promising outlook for the 
Indian retail sector.
Reliance Retail with its 
industry leading store 
network and emerging 
digital platforms, 
investments across the 
consumption value chain 
and its track record of 
strong execution is well 
poised to lead the industry 
in the coming decade.
The Conscious Culture Festival at 
Jio World Drive was an innovative 
and visionary initiative aimed at 
promoting sustainable prosperity by 
fostering a culture that provided a new 
positive vision for the future. A two-
day immersive event held between 
March 4 and 5, 2023 at the Jio World 
Drive in Mumbai, was carefully 
curated to inspire and influence 
change in the community. The 
festival provided a platform for trade, 
art, networking, collaborations and 
learning opportunities in a sustainable 
lifestyle space. The objective of the 
festival was to inspire people to 
build conscious habits by delivering 
experiences that demanded mindful 
actions and exposing them to the 
best conscious homegrown brands 
across fashion, food, home & beauty. 
Alongside, talks and workshops 
were held on upcycling techniques, 
plant care and games conducted 
such as Sustainability Pictionary. The 
event production was designed to 
be carbon conscious, with focus on 
the usage of sustainable materials 
and efficient waste management, 
ensuring the festival’s environmental 
impact was minimised. The Conscious 
Culture Festival at Jio World Drive 
was a significant step towards 
promoting sustainability and creating 
awareness about the importance of 
conscious living.
Conscious Culture 
Festival at Jio World 
Drive, Mumbai
Reliance Retail’s theme of 
“Democratising Learning” during the last 
financial year was aimed to empower 
employees to take control of their own 
development and design their careers 
within the Company. The focus of all 
learning initiatives was to create a pull-
based learning culture that customises 
learning to employees’ preferences and 
enables anytime-anywhere-anyplace 
learning. To ensure all employees have 
the desired capability, the learning 
team works at five levels: Ready to 
jumpstart, Strive to perform, Aspire to 
grow, Equip with Future Skills, and Build 
Leadership Capabilities.
i.	
The “Ready to Jumpstart” 
programme offers a structured 
learning journey for new 
employees, including organisational 
orientation, culture immersion, 
role-based certifications, and 
manager orientation. Cadre Building 
programmes focus on nurturing 
young talent and hiring and 
developing them.
ii.	
In the “Strive to Perform” phase, 
employees continuously upskill and 
reskill to perform effectively in their 
current role. Reliance Retail offers 
easy access to on-demand learning 
opportunities and a Competency-
Based Learning System (CBLS) that 
recommends courses based on 
identified competency gaps.

Jio transformed the mobile 
broadband industry, which 
led to overall wireless 
broadband subscriber 
base in the country 
increasing to well over 
800 million users. 
Over 300 million 2G SIM 
users in the country are 
yet to experience the 
full benefits of digital 
communication networks. 
Increasing affordability and 
launch of devices at lower 
price points would drive 
Jio consolidated its 
leadership position in all 
22 circles by acquiring the 
right to use spectrum in 
the 700MHz, 800MHz, 
1800MHz, 3300MHz 
and 26GHz bands. The 
cost of acquiring the 
right to use the 25,036 
MHz technology-agnostic 
spectrum for 20 years 
amounted to J87,947 
crore. As per the terms of 
the auction, Jio has opted 
for the deferred payment 
option and accordingly, 
paid an upfront amount 
of J7,865 crore and 
balance of J80,082 crore

### Context Before Table:
Indian dairy farmers are saddled with 
labour-intensive operations including 
the monitoring and upkeep of cattle. 
This leads to low productivity, high 
animal mortality rates and increased 
costs. Despite being the leading dairy 
producer globally, India’s per capita 
milk production is significantly lower 
than that of global producers.
Jio’s cattle IoT device will assist in 
monitoring the activity levels, food 
habits and rumination of the cattle, 
and also in the detection of early signs 
of diseases. The data collected by 
the device can be shared in real-time 
for benchmarking and analysing 
cattle health and productivity 
using AI. This is then shared with 
the farmer daily through the Jio 
GauSamriddhi application.
With Jio True 5G, retail experiences 
are set to transform. Users can create 
a 3D avatar with a depth sensor-
enabled camera. Using a life-sized 
smart mirror, users can virtually 
try-on a variety of clothing options. 
This can significantly improve the 
choices on offer and add convenience 
to the process, and enhance the 
shopping experience.
Digital Services
Jio’s digital services span 
the entire ecosystem, 
and these capabilities will 
power scale-up of all our 
businesses. This would 
equip Jio to spearhead 
India’s transformation 
into a leading Digital 
Society. Once proven 
at scale, these solutions 
can also be taken to 
the rest of the world. 
Jio True 5G is uniquely 
positioned to deliver 
the best quality, highest 
value digital connectivity 
solutions to every citizen 
of India. The scale of Jio’s 
5G rollout will give it a 
distinct competitive edge 
and accelerate market 
share gains. All this 
will generate strong 
shareholder returns over 
the next several decades.
Approximately 65% of the Indian population lives in rural 
areas with limited access to high-quality, critical pre-
emptive diagnostics. In addition to this, the doctor-patient 
ratio is as low as 1:2000. These limitations often lead to 
delayed detection of diseases, escalated treatment costs, 
and a higher mortality rate.
To address this, Jio will enable a robotic teleradiology 
set‑up with a radiological probe at remote sites and a 
haptic controller at specialist doctor sites. Camera feeds will

real-time feedback can be shared with specialised doctors.
Jio 5G can significantly boost per

and drone-based precision farming 
solutions. 5G-powered drones can 
be flown remotely from distant 
control centres from actual sites 
such as farmers’ premises, district 
or taluka offices, or even the state 
or central headquarters. Drones can 
cover farmlands and multi-spectral 
cameras can be used to scan the 
fields with real-time relay of images 
on the cloud over the 5G network. 
The data can then be analysed using 
AI/ML algorithms to detect insect 
or pest infestations, soil moisture 
and irrigation.
Jio Krishi IoT devices such as weather

judicious use of harmful chemicals, 
and improvement in farm productivity.

## Content Block 159
With 7.2% GDP growth in FY 2022‑23, 
India is one of the fastest growing 
major economies in the world. 
Despite the impact of high inflation 
due to the sharp rise in oil prices post 
US-Ukraine conflict as well as the 
disruption of global supply chains in 
the aftermath of the pandemic, Indian 
economy fared better than the rest 
of the world. However, consumer 
demand slowed down in the first half 
as prices of consumer goods increased 
to keep pace with raw material 
prices. The increase in lending rates 
in the second half also impacted 
the industrial growth and consumer 
spending power. 
Media and Entertainment sector, 
being inextricably linked to the 
macro‑economic environment, 
also faced headwinds during the 
year. While Y-o-Y growth (CY2022 
vs CY2021) was strong at ~20%, 
compared to pre-pandemic levels 
of 2019, total revenue was only 
10% higher. The demand for content

mpared to pre-pandemic levels 
of 2019, total revenue was only 
10% higher. The demand for content 
continued to grow as consumers 
increasingly spent more time on 
media consumption, but monetisation 
faced challenges on both advertising 
and subscription fronts. Growth during 
the year was driven by 30%5 growth 
in Digital segment. Digital advertising, 
including spends by small and 
medium sized businesses, for whom 
digital is often the only marketing 
platform due to limited budgets, 
commanded more than 50% share of 
the total ad revenues. TV’s share in 
the total ad pie declined by ~500 bps 
as the ad revenue on the medium was 
flat. As per various industry reports, 
TV and Digital are the most effective 
mediums for brand building and 
reach, capturing nearly 80% share of 
the total ad spends. Print continued 
to struggle and despite a 13% Y-o-Y 
growth, it remains well below the

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
as consumers returned to cinemas and several movies achieved phenomenal 
box-office success. For CY2023, the reports forecast that the M&E industry

expected to grow at low single-digit rate.

As per the same report, India currently 
has 85-90mn paid subscriptions, 
which is expected to nearly double 
to 160-165mn by 2027. Bundling 
of subscriptions through telecom 
plans and emergence of aggregator 
platforms is also expected to aid 
this growth. 
OTT advertising will continue to 
grow on the back of increasing 
internet-connected audience, growing 
time-spend and improving targeting 
advertising capabilities. 
Internet-connected mobile phones 
have been the primary driver for the 
massive growth in digital content 
consumption, responsible for nearly 
90% of this growth. However, the

is growth. However, the 
engagement levels on big screens 
(TV) continue to be much higher 
than handsets. Connected TVs 
(CTV) offer the best features of both 
traditional and digital eco-system 
– a large screen size and ability for 
targeted advertising, thus providing 
an opportunity to brands to reach 
premium audiences in an intelligent 
fashion. Due to a low penetration of 
CTVs, advertising on the medium is 
currently at a nascent stage in India, at 
just over 1% of total TV spends.
New Tariff Order Finally 
Clears Legal Hurdles
After being mired in multiple 
litigation challenges for more than 
two years, the New Tariff Order was 
cleared for implementation after the 
regulatory body, TRAI, amended 
the regulation post an industry-wide 
consultation process. 
The proposal to lower the price ceiling

 the price ceiling 
for including a channel in a bouquet 
to `12 was dropped, reverting to the 
earlier price limit of `19. Another key 
proposal to introduce a discount cap 
of 33% on the bouquet price vis a vis 
a-la-carte price was modified, with the 
discount limit increased to 45%. While 
a few appeals were filed against the 
new regulation by some distribution 
platforms, it was implemented in 
February 2023.
Connected TVs – A Promising Growth Opportunity
Key Hindi General 
Entertainment Channels 
moved out of the DD 
Freedish Platform
At the beginning of the year, all the 
major broadcasters took their FTA 
channels off DD Freedish distribution 
platform. This had an impact on 
viewership, up to 90% for some of 
these channels, as they run older 
content which doesn’t get much 
viewership on pay platforms.
Subsequently, it also impacted the ad 
revenue growth for these channels 
and the networks. However, it has

Subsequently, it also impacted the ad 
revenue growth for these channels 
and the networks. However, it has 
helped to slow down the loss of 
pay-TV subscribers, an issue which 
has affected the industry since the 
implementation of the New Tariff 
Order (NTO) in early 2019, followed 
20-23% 
CAGR
by the pandemic a year later. Given 
that the quality of content on these 
channels is superior to most of the 
other content available on the FTA 
platform, it provides an incentive for 
consumers to upgrade and become 
pay subscribers.

multi-cam feed for sporting events on 
digital platform which gives audience 
control of their viewing experience and 
option to choose from 12-language 
audio feed, innovation continues to be 
the driving force.
   Content consumption on digital 
platforms is growing. With over 500 
million people consuming content on 
digital/OTT platforms, digital has 
now become a secondary screen, 
and in some cases the primary.
   Network18 is focused on creating 
digital platforms which become the default 
destinations for content consumption. 
The group is not only investing in content 
creation for its platforms but is also 
leveraging technological innovations to 
provide consumers with a seamless and 
unique experience on the medium of 
their choice. JioCinema’s IPL streaming 
reached ~450mn consumers with 
innovative features, setting new reach and 
engagement benchmarks. News18.com 
and Moneycontrol are amongst the top 
destinations for digital news audience.

Oil to Chemicals
FY 2022-23 was a year of high 
volatility and uncertainty in oil markets 
amid higher geopolitical tensions due 
to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 
This led to significant rise in oil prices 
in the year with Brent crude reaching 
$123.7/bbl in June 2022. 
Europe imposed an embargo on 
imports of Russian crude oil and 
refined products in December 2022 
and February 2023 respectively. These 
European sanctions further led to 
re-routing of global crude and product 
trade flows.
Global oil demand continued to rise 
in FY 2022-23 despite being impacted 
by high oil prices, China’s Covid 
lockdowns during the first half of the 
year, and global economic growth 
concerns during the second half of 
the year.
International air travel rose steadily 
throughout the year as most countries 
lifted restrictions with covid related 
concerns receding. Global refinery 
operations also increased on support 
of rising demand. Improving mobility 
and gas to oil switching, amid high 
natural gas prices, also supported oil 
demand growth during the year. 
Tightening of monetary policy by 
Central Banks caused concerns on 
economic recovery leading to sharp 
drop in oil prices in March 2023.
Crude Oil Demand 
and Supply
Global Oil demand in CY 2022 
increased by 2.3 mb/d to 99.8 mb/d.
High oil prices and China Covid 
lockdowns limited oil demand growth 
in the year. However, demand growth

was supported by improving mobility,

### Context After Table:
rising air travel demand, increasing use 
of oil for power generation and gas to 
oil switching in the industrial sector.
Global oil supply increased by 4.5 mb/d 
to 99.9 mb/d in CY 2022. Oil supply 
growth was strong in the year in both 
OPEC and Non-OPEC countries. OPEC 
supply growth was led by Saudi Arabia, 
UAE and Iraq. Non-OPEC supply 
growth was led by US.
Global Refining Operations
During FY 2022-23, Global refinery 
operations increased steadily on the 
back of strong demand, high refinery 
margins and also due to start-up 
of new refineries in Middle East, US 
and China.
In CY 2022, global refinery throughput 
was 1.9 mb/d higher than in CY 2021. 
Overall refinery utilisation reached 82% 
by March 23. Refiners increased run 
rates to take advantage of the higher 
product cracks.
Refining margins were strong in 
FY 2022-23 as concerns of loss of 
Russian product exports to Europe due 
to sanctions led to huge disruption in 
global trade flows. Margins were healthy 
in the year mainly due to strong middle 
distillate cracks amid rising fuel demand 
and lower global inventories.

Crude Oil, LNG and Ethane Prices
Oil Prices
Crude oil prices rose sharply in 
FY 2022-23 with Brent price averaging 
$96.2/ bbl in the year. Higher crude 
oil prices during February 2022 to 
August 2022 were mainly on account 
of war premium as an after effect 
of Russia Ukraine conflict. Brent oil 
rose to high levels of $123.7/bbl in 
June 2022 amid rising demand and on 
concerns of impact of upcoming EU 
embargo on Russian oil imports from 
December 2022. However, Oil prices 
started to cool down after June 2022 
as US increased SPR oil sales and 
Russia was able to divert much of its 
crude oil exports from Europe to Asia.
Oil price volatility continued through 
the year with Brent oil prices falling 
to $81.1/ bbl in December 2022 on 
recessionary concerns while Russian 
oil exports remained resilient. China

LNG Prices
During the year, LNG prices were 
highly volatile, with Asian prices 
ranging from a high of $71.25/MMBtu 
in April 2022 to a low of $12.10/
MMBtu in March 2023. Asian LNG 
prices averaged at $32.96/MMBtu in 
FY 2022-23. 
Geopolitical tensions reduced pipeline 
gas flow from Russia to Europe leading 
to decrease in European inventories 
by Q1 2022. Also, significant outages 
at LNG terminals like USA, Australia, 
Malaysia tightened LNG availability 
during FY 2022-23. 
In anticipation of the winter season, 
despite a tight LNG market, Europe 
acquired an additional 45 MT of LNG 
over and above their 2021 volume 
to substitute Russian pipeline gas to 
build inventory. 
These events resulted in significant 
increase in LNG prices during Q2 2022. 
However, high LNG prices and tight 
COVID restrictions in China led to 
demand destruction in Asia (7%) and 
Europe (13%). 
In addition, the relatively mild winter 
experienced in Europe and Asia 
resulted in sustained high inventories 
towards the end of winter 2022, which 
subsequently contributed to reduction 
of LNG prices by March 2023.

Ethane Prices
In February 2023, Reliance completed 
six years of ethane value chain project. 
The ethane chain acted as a virtual 
pipeline from US to India ensuring 
uninterrupted ethane supply to our 
crackers and providing them feedstock 
security, flexibility and a unique 
competitive advantage.
During the year, ethane prices were 
highly volatile, seeing a high of 68.0 
US cents per gallon (cpg) in June 2022 
and a low of 22.7 cpg in February 2023. 
As ethane prices moved in tandem 
with natural gas prices for most of the 
year, prices peaked in anticipation of 
strong winter and low inventory levels. 
However, the Freeport LNG terminal 
shutdown, rising interest rates and 
milder winter eased ethane prices.

Global gasoline demand growth remained steady during the year on rising mobility. In CY 2022, demand recovered to 
97.5% of pre-pandemic levels (CY 2019 levels) to 26.0 mb/d as restrictions on mobility were lifted gradually by various 
countries. China lifted Covid related mobility restrictions in December 2022.
With this being the first complete year 
since FY 2020-21 without any specific 
(pandemic led or otherwise) demand 
disruption in the country, there has 
been healthy growth of petroleum 
products in the country despite 
elevated retail selling prices.
India’s oil demand grew by 10.2% 
and stood at 222.3 MMT. LPG 
demand also maintained an upward 
growth trajectory.
Strong economic traction is 
reflected in the double-digit growth 
demonstrated by gasoil and gasoline 
with demand for both fuels surpassing 
peak demand levels of pre-pandemic 
times. While gasoil demand has grown 
The average price of ethane for FY 2022‑23 was 44.4 cpg. Despite relatively 
higher prices, ethane continued to be the preferred as a competitive feedstock in 
the region.
Global diesel demand was strong 
during the year due to improving 
economy and rising industrial activity. 
In CY 2022, diesel demand recovered 
to pre-pandemic levels to reach 
28.3 mb/d. 
Jet fuel demand gradually increased 
through the year. It recovered to 78% 
of pre-pandemic levels in CY 2022 
to 6.2 mb/d amid slow recovery in 
business and international travel.
Domestic Market 
Environment
Indian transportation fuel market has 
bounced back completely to register 
new highs across both HSD and 
MS segment in FY 2022-23. Despite 
being significantly below pre-covid 
levels, ATF volumes have shown the 
steepest growth.
by 12%, gasoline has grown back at 
13% on Y-o-Y basis.
Despite the slowdown concerns of 
previous year, both state-owned oil 
marketing companies and private 
players have continued expanding 
their network, adding over 4,000 
outlets in FY 2022-23, and taking the 
total number of retail outlets in India 
to over 90,000.
Buoyant economic activity in the 
country, consistent growth in 2w and 
4w sales, continued enhancement 
of road infrastructure and increase 
in retail outlet network augurs well 
for maintaining the momentum in 
transportation fuels demand growth in 
the country over the coming decade.

### Context Before Table:
Oil to Chemicals
The Electric Vehicle market in India 
scaled up significantly in FY 2022-23 
with 6,600+ charging stations and 
cumulative country-wide EV’s of 
2.7 Mn.
Building on the steady growth shown 
largely on back of domestic travel, 
Aviation industry has grown by more 
than 47% in FY 2022-23. This is on 
the back of unleashing of pent-up 
travel demand both within India and 
outside due to lockdown concerns 
over the last few years. That the 
growth is coming despite churn and 
consolidation amongst the airline 
players augurs well for sustained 
growth of Indian Aviation sector.
Margins
Gasoline margins rose to $14.7/
bbl in FY 2022-23 from $11.4/bbl in 
FY 2021‑22 backed by steady demand 
growth and improving mobility. 
The recovery of transport demand 
post Covid partially offset demand 
loss due to high fuel prices. Limited 
exports from China also supported 
gasoline cracks.
Gasoil margins rose sharply to $40.7/
bbl in FY 2022-23 from $12.3/bbl 
in FY 2021-22 amid strong global 
demand growth on rising economic 
activity. Also, uncertainties around 
Russian diesel supply due to EU 
embargo on Russian products, 
gas to oil switching and low global 
inventories kept gasoil margins strong 
during the year.
Jet fuel cracks rose to $32.9/bbl 
in FY 2022-23 from $9.1/bbl in 
FY 2021‑22. Jet fuel margins increased 
on support of steady demand growth 
and strong gasoil margins.

Polymers and Elastomers
Global Market Environment
Global polymer demand in CY 2022 
was stable at 245 MMT on Y-o-Y 
basis. Global polyethylene (PE) 
demand grew by 0.3%, polypropylene 
(PP) demand remained flat, while PVC 
demand contracted by 3.4% in CY 
2022. Growth in global demand for 
Styrene Butadiene Rubber (E-SBR) 
was 4% and Polybutadiene Rubber 
(PBR) was 2% in FY 2022-23 on the 
back of automotive sector demand. 
Global Cracker Operations: Global 
Ethylene demand increased by 2% Y-o-Y 
to 183 MMT in CY 2022 against 8% 
Y-o-Y growth in CY2021. New capacity 
addition of 10 MMTA in CY2022 
resulted in lower operating rates at 85% 
compared to 86% in CY2021.
Ethane and Naphtha Prices: 
US Ethane average prices increased by 
27% Y-o-Y from 35 cpg to 44 cpg in 
FY 2022-23, led by higher Natural gas 
prices. Naphtha average prices in Asia 
were down by 3% Y-o-Y from $718/MT 
to $696/MT, due to lower demand 
from Petrochemicals.
Domestic Market Environment
PP domestic market demand grew 
by 6% on Y-o-Y basis on account 
of healthy demand from health & 
hygiene sector and Biaxially Oriented 
Polypropylene (BOPP) packaging. 
PE demand registered 8% growth 
Y-o-Y basis majorly driven by pipes, 
insulation, e-commerce, FMCG and 
liquid packaging. PVC demand grew 
by 32% Y-o-Y, driven by growth in 
construction activities and policy 
boost for several water and sewage 
pipeline projects.
Indian PBR market grew by 7% Y-o-Y, 
while SBR market declined by 1%. 
Margins
Polymer prices weakened during 
FY 2022-23 amidst lower demand 
from China due to COVID related 
restrictions including recessionary 
concerns in major developed markets. 
Global operating rate for PP, PE and 
PVC averaged 81%, 83% and 79% 
respectively during CY2022, lower 
than CY2021. Polymer margins 
weakened during the year as product 
prices declined more than feedstock 
prices. Integrated PP-Naphtha, HDPE-
Naphtha and PVC margins contracted 
by 32%, 15% and 17% respectively 
during the year.
Intermediates and Polyesters
Global Market Environment
Global demand for intermediates 
(PX/PTA/MEG) increased marginally 
by 1% to 159 MMT in CY 2022 from 
157 MMT in CY 2021, as markets 
remained under pressure due to 
volatility in crude prices, high energy 
costs and weak demand in China. 
PX demand grew marginally by 2% 
while supply remained tight due to

### Context After Table:
production cut by few PX producers 
amidst unfavorable economics. PTA 
demand marginally reduced by 1% 
to 75 MMT in CY2022 due to high 
inventory of Polyester products 
in China and weak downstream 
demand. MEG witnessed flat 
demand at 33 MMT in CY2022. 
MEG operating rates dropped from 
66% to 58% in CY2022 with higher 
capacity additions.
Polyester overall global demand 
remained flat at 85 MMT in CY2022 
amid inflationary concerns. Global 
polyester markets were under pressure 
as demand weakened in China due 
to Covid related restrictions. Western 
markets too witnessed lacklustre 
demand on account of high inflation 
and slowdown in economic activities.
Domestic Market Environment
Intermediates demand improved by 
4% on account of continued recovery 
in textile and polyester demand. 
Overall Polyester demand grew by 
14% in FY 2022-23. PET witnessed 
strong growth of 28% followed by 
PSF 17% and PFY 10%. Demand 
revived strongly on account of 
resumption of normalcy in schools, 
offices, festive and marriage related 
celebrations and increase in tourism 
activity post removal of Covid related 
restrictions. High cotton prices aided 
usage conversion from cotton to 
polyester globally.
Margins
In FY 2022-23, PX prices improved 
by 16%, while PX-Naphtha margins 
surged by 63% surpassing the 5-year 
average of $303/MT. Integrated 
producers continued to optimise 
production based on PX vs. 
Gasoline economics.
PTA market in China was impacted 
due to weak downstream demand. 
PTA producers responded by 
moderating operating rates and 
keeping check on inventory levels. 
PTA prices registered gain of 15%, 
while PTA-PX margins improved 
by 8%.
MEG margins were under pressure as 
inventory remained high due to weak 
downstream demand and high energy 
cost. MEG-Naphtha margins reduced 
significantly by 78% as the MEG prices 
dropped by 22% while Naphtha prices 
remained firm.

post-consumer used PET bottles and 
R|Elan™ EcoGold with CiClO® together 
with an aesthetic variant, R|Elan™ 
FreeFlow to create their stunning 
collection, ‘Midnight Botanica 2023’.
'Midnight Botanica 2023' collection 
had a rich, dark, dreamy look with 
stark contrasting hues of the night 
and botanical inspirations. Floating 
fashionably down the ramp were 
light‑as-air chiffons, crepes and 
organzas that were turned into 
swirling dresses, jumpsuits and 
red‑carpet-worthy flowing Grecian 
gowns. The romantic colours set 
the mood for the collection as fiery 
red and delicate ivory were merged 
skilfully with strong jewel tones. 
The spring-summer R|Elan™ EcoGold 
line by Gauri and Nainika’s collection 
was inspired by Grecian lines and 
incorporated styles that were inclusive 
and generous and warm and designed

differentiated fuel) and convenience solutions (under Wild Bean Café – WBC), 
Jio-bp is helping the leading majors in IT, FMCG and Auto sector. Their unique 
fuel portfolio reduces supply chain carbon footprint of these majors and brand 
recall of WBC gets new motorists to Jio-bp fuel forecourt. This is a first-of-its-
kind corporate-mobility solution provider partnership in India.
Taking accurate data in remote 
highways for demand assessment of 
new retail outlets is time consuming, 
costly and error prone process. 
Through drone technology in 
partnership with Asteria, RIL has 
found a innovative solution at a 
fraction of cost and time with close 
to 100% data accuracy. The project 
was recently awarded as Geospatial 
Awards 2022.

### Context After Table:
Technology can help surmount the 
biggest of operational challenges, 
if used innovatively. Through 
smart CCTV, RIL has deployed 
remote monitoring system which 
automatically alerts employee / 
workers if they are not compliant with 
service or HSSE SOP at operating or 
under construction site respectively.
Remote Monitoring – 
Eye in the Sky
CASE STUDY
CASE STUDY
100% additivated fuel is the heart 
of RIL retail fuel offering. To 
facilitate that RIL has created unique 
independent facility adding a new 
name – Automated Dosing Facility – 
to Indian petroleum industry. Manned 
by only a handful of resources these 
sites constructed at the cost of low 
end retail outlets is a testimony 
of technological brilliance. This is 
ensuring every single drop of RIL 
oil is additivated even if it is coming 
through hospitality location.
ADF Facility – Making a 
New Start
CASE STUDY
OUTLOOK
Oil Demand is expected to 
remain healthy on the back 
of steady economic growth. 
New supply from upcoming 
refining capacities in 
Middle East, China and 
Africa will likely keep the 
market balanced. Oil price 
and product cracks to 
remain firm as global trade 
realigns in the aftermath 
of Russia Ukraine conflict. 
Relaxation in Chinese Zero 
Covid Policy is expected 
to boost China demand. 
Trade flows are likely to 
improve with easing out of 
supply chain disruptions. 
Polymer domestic demand 
is expected to be strong, 
driven mainly by growth in 
e-commerce, packaging, 
durables, auto and 
infrastructure segments. 
Strong demand likely to 
continue for Pipe sectors 
backed by infrastructure 
projects.

Oil and Gas  
E&P
The key focus of the E&P business has been safe and reliable 
operations and project delivery while maximising the production 
from the deepwater and CBM fields.
The production has been ramped up to 20 MMSCMD from the 
R & Satellite Cluster fields. With the commissioning of the MJ field 
in 1Q FY 2023-24, the KG D6 block will produce ~1 BCFe/day by 
FY 2023-24, thereby contributing ~30% of India’s gas production.
This will significantly reduce the dependence on costly imported 
gas and bridge the gap in India’s energy requirements especially 
in times of geopolitical uncertainty and constrained supply.
The focus of the E&P business continues to be on safeguarding the 
health and safety of the people and assets while simultaneously 
augmenting gas production. Incremental Gas production from 
MJ field along with production from KG D6 Block is expected to deliver 
~30 MMSCMD in FY 2023-24.

2022 was another volatile year for 
global oil markets on account of 
unprecedented challenges. At the 
start of the year, strong oil demand 
growth was expected as the economy 
continued its recovery from the global 
pandemic. However, Russia-Ukraine 
conflict introduced huge geopolitical 
uncertainties and caused energy 
prices to soar.
Global oil demand in CY 2022 grew 
over 2 million b/d from 2021 but 
remained below pre-pandemic levels.
The Brent crude oil price averaged 
$96.2/bbl in FY 2022-23 and the WTI 
spot price averaged $95/bbl. Oil prices 
rose significantly in the first half of 
2022 due to geopolitical tension but 
declined in the second half of the year.
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
Natural gas witnessed record high 
prices in 2022 due to steep decline 
in Russian piped gas supply to 
Europe, higher gas burn in the power 
sector and strong storage injections. 
Europe TTF spot prices averaged a 
record high of $38/MMBtu in 2022 
while Henry Hub prices averaged 
$6/MMBtu, their highest level 
since 2008. Asian spot LNG prices 
also averaged $32.96/MMBtu for 
FY 2022-23 which is highest level 
on record.
Record high gas prices led to 
an unprecedented reduction in 
gas demand in industry in 2022. 
Gas consumption declined by an 
estimated 2% in Asia and 13% in 
Europe (over 70 BCM). United States 
experienced growth of 5.4% in gas 
consumption largely due to colder 
than average temperatures during the 
heating season.
LNG demand was dominated by a 
sharp surge in gross LNG imports 
into Europe, which was balanced 
by a steep decline in the rest of the 
world, particularly in Asia. LNG supply 
growth was relatively modest in 2022 
at 5.5%, despite an unprecedented rise 
in LNG demand in Europe following 
the gradual decline in Russian pipeline 
gas deliveries throughout the year.
The Govt. of India appointed Dr. Kirit 
Parikh Committee to review domestic 
natural gas pricing. The Committee 
recommended removal of price ceiling 
on gas produced from High Pressure 
High Temperature (HPHT) fields from 
January 1, 2026.

### Context Before Table:
Oil and Gas E&P
Reliance’s Oil & Gas business 
encompasses complete chain 
of activities from exploration to 
production across a portfolio 
comprising of exploratory Blocks 
NEC‑25 and KG UDW1, and 
development and production from 
deepwater KG D6 Block and two 
CBM blocks.
Since the commencement of 
production till date the Block KG 
D6 has produced 3 TCFe of gas, oil 
and condensate while establishing 
several global benchmarks in terms 
of operational performance, including 
99.9% uptime and 100% incident-
free operations. The three integrated 
projects – R Cluster, Satellite Cluster 
and MJ – have been leveraging the 
existing hub infrastructure in place by 
utilising existing production facilities 
and thus reducing costs.
In FY 2022-23, on back of higher 
production and improved price 
realisation, the business delivered 
a robust performance.
~30 MMSCMD
EXPECTED GAS PRODUCTION 
IN FY 2023-24
KG D6
Deepwater Production 
Update
RIL successfully and safely delivered 
R Cluster & Satellite Cluster projects 
in the KG D6 Block during the peak 
COVID times.
Currently both the fields together 
are producing about 20 MMSCMD 
gas and contributing ~20% to India’s 
gas production.
MJ Deepwater Development 
Update
MJ Field has started producing gas 
and condensate from 1Q FY 2023‑24. 
All offshore installation and 
commissioning works have been 
completed. Floating Production 
Storage and Offloading (FPSO) is at 
the field. Drilling and completion of 
wells is in progress.
Incremental gas production from MJ 
field, combined with gas production 
from R Cluster and Satellite Cluster 
fields, is expected to deliver ~30 
MMSCMD in FY 2023-24.
Combined production from these 
three projects is expected to enhance 
India’s energy security in volatile 
market environment. With the 
incremental production from MJ field, 
KG D6 block is expected to contribute 
around 30% of India’s gas production.
Exploration Strategy
Block KGUDWHP-2018/ (KG‑UDW1) 
was awarded to RIL-BP JV under 
OALP II licensing round and 
Petroleum Exploration License (PEL) 
was issued in August 2019.
Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and 
related challenges, the 3D Seismic 
Acquisition and Processing campaign 
was completed in the Block. Currently 
Seismic data interpretation and 
prospect maturation is ongoing, post 
which first exploration well is planned 
to be drilled in the Block.
Abandonment
D1 D3 Field ceased production in 
February 2020, following which the 
Oil Industry Safety Directorate (OISD) 
and Management Committee (MC) 
have approved the permanent Plug 
& Abandonment (P&A) of wells and 
in-situ abandonment of the associated 
equipment. P&A of one well in the 
D1 D3 field has been completed in 
FY 2022-23. Procurement of Rig & 
Services to complete P&A of the 
balance wells in the D1 D3 field 
is ongoing.
Following cessation of production in 
2018, MA Field was decommissioned, 
Hydrocarbon freeing of flexible 
flowlines and flushing of umbilicals 
was completed and FPSO was 
demobilised. The flexible flowlines, 
dynamic flexibles dynamic umbilicals, 
subsea structures, mooring 
lines and STP buoy have been 
decommissioned. In FY 2022-23, P&A 
Activities have been completed in 
all wells in accordance with the Field 
Decommissioning Plan approved by 
the OISD and the MC.

### Context After Table:
RIL is currently producing Coal Bed 
Methane (CBM) from its block SP 
(West)–CBM–2001/1. More than 
300 wells are in production with an 
average output of 0.73 MMSCMD gas 
during the year.
To sustain plateau production 
further CBM development is being 
undertaken in blocks SP (West)–
CBM–2001/1 and SP (East)–CBM–
2001/1.
Reliance Gas Pipeline Limited, 
a subsidiary of RIL, operates the 
302 km Shahdol-Phulpur Pipeline 
from Shahdol (MP) to Phulpur (UP)

Update on Arbitrations and 
Other Legal Issues
KG D6 Cost Recovery 
Arbitration
Arbitration claim commenced by the 
Company in November 2011 seeking 
declaration that it is entitled to recover 
100% of its contract costs under the 
Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) 
for the KG D6 Block. The matter is at 
the stage of Final Hearing as part of 
arbitration proceedings. Government 
of India has filed an application before 
the Arbitration Tribunal alleging that 
majority of the Tribunal members 
are biased and cannot continue 
hearing the dispute. The Arbitration 
Tribunal has reserved its decision on 
Government’s bias application.
Public Interest 
Litigations (PILs)
Three PILs were filed before the 
Supreme Court in 2013 against the 
Company in relation to the KG D6 
PSC, seeking reliefs in the nature 
of disallowance of cost recovery, 
quashing GOI’s decision to approve 
certain gas price formula and 
termination of PSC. The Company has 
submitted that the underlying issues 
in the PILs are already subject matter 
of ongoing arbitrations relating to the 
KG D6 Block. Matter is still pending in 
the Supreme Court.
PMT Arbitration
Arbitration was initiated by BG 
Exploration and Production 
India Limited and the Company 
(together the Claimants) against 
the Government of India (GOI) on 
December 16, 2010 under PSCs, for 
Panna – Mukta and Tapti blocks 
due to difference in interpretation 
of certain PSC provisions between 
Claimants and Government. 
The Arbitral Tribunal by majority 
issued a final partial award (‘2016 
FPA’), and separately, two dissenting 
opinions in the matter on October 12, 
2016. Claimants challenged certain 
parts of the 2016 FPA before the 
English Courts, which delivered 
its judgment on April 16, 2018 and 
remitted one of the challenged issues 
back to the Arbitral Tribunal for 
reconsideration. The Arbitral Tribunal 
decided in favour of the Claimants in 
large part vide its final partial award 
dated October 1, 2018 (‘2018 FPA’). 
The Government and Claimants 
filed an appeal before the English 
Commercial Court against this 2018 
FPA. The English Commercial Court 
rejected Government’s challenges 
to 2018 FPA and upheld Claimants’ 
challenge in February 2020 and 
remitted the underlying issue in 
challenge back to the Arbitration 
Tribunal for determination. Tribunal 
gave favorable award on January 29, 
2021 (“EPOD Agreements Case 
Award”).
Government challenged the EPOD 
Agreements Case Award before 
the English High Court which was 
dismissed on June 9, 2022 by Judge, 
Sir Ross Cranston. Claimants have 
filed an application before the Arbitral 
Tribunal seeking increase in the PSC 
Cost Recovery Limits and the same is 
sub-judice. 
Arbitral Tribunal is yet to schedule 
the final re-computation of accounts 
and the quantification phase of the 
arbitration, which will take place post 
determination of Claimants’ request 
for increase in cost recovery limit 
under the PSCs.
The Government has also filed an 
execution petition before the Hon’ble 
Delhi High Court under sections 
47 and 49 of the Arbitration and 
Conciliation Act, 1996 and Section 
151 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 
seeking enforcement and execution 
of the 2016 FPA, ignoring the 
judgments of English High Court and 
the subsequent Tribunal Awards. The 
Claimants contend that Government’s 
Execution Petition is not maintainable.

RIL KG D6 CSR ACTIVITIES 2022-23
Education
Newly constructed 
classrooms
On the request of authorities, new 
classrooms constructed in Gadimoga 
High School to cater to the needs 
of increasing number of school 
going children.
New Technologies
RIL is engaged in R&D efforts 
to increase recovery from CBM 
fields. The current focus of this 
research is Bio-CBM.
The Bio-CBM technology uses 
microbe injection to produce 
in-situ methane in places where 
either the coals are devoid of 
methane or conventional CBM 
extraction is uneconomical.
Several microbial consortia were 
isolated from various locations 
within India and screened for 
methane production potential. 
The best consortium was 
optimised under bottle and 
scale up conditions. Besides this, 
the commercially available coal 
specific synthetic consortia were 
evaluated and have shown very 
high methane productivity
To mimic some of the field 
conditions, a core flood reactor 
was designed and built. The 
isolated microbial consortia as 
well as the synthetic consortia 
were tested successfully for 
their ability to produce methane 
under low porosity and high-
pressure conditions in this 
reactor. Other variables such as 
coal size, recirculation of media 
and nutrient augmentation were 
also tested successfully in the 
core flood reactor.
Lab tests and preliminary field 
trials have shown encouraging 
results with respect to methane 
production potential. Research 
work is underway to establish 
ability of this technology to scale 
up to a commercial operation.
RIL is leveraging its infrastructure 
(advance laboratories), requisite 
diverse inter-disciplinary technical 
skills, CBM production expertise, 
CBM fields and knowledge 
of regulatory requirements 
to give impetus to the Bio-
CBM research.

Risk Description
Climate change continues to feature in the top 10 global risks cited by the Global Risk Report 2023. Global warming 
is having a compounding effect on the climate system, resulting in increased humanitarian challenges and further 
straining already stretched fiscal balances. 
For businesses, climate change risks manifests in two broader categories, namely physical and transition risks, as 
outlined by global frameworks. Physical risks refer to the potential impacts on a company caused by both short-term 
extreme weather events (acute) and long-term changes in climate patterns (chronic). On the other hand, transition 
risks pertain to the potential hazards businesses may face as the world transitions to a lower-carbon energy system 
which includes risks due to policy changes, legal action, technological advancements, shifts in supply and demand, 
and changes in stakeholder attitudes.

RISKS AND RESPONSE
Physical Risk
Throughout the year, an array of 
climate change induced weather 
events was experienced around 
the globe and in India too. These 
calamities included extreme weather 
events like intense heatwaves, 
cyclones, erratic rainfall, floods, 
and others, affecting almost every 
region of the country and causing 
unprecedented levels of destruction. 
Having a wide geographical spread, 
the organisation is susceptible to 
such erratic weather phenomenon 
which could cause disruptions in 
its operations and supply chains, in 
addition to causing negative impact 
on the wellbeing of our people and 
our assets.

Transition Risk
Risks Related to Policies, Law and 
Regulations
Driven by ongoing geopolitical 
tensions and the urgency to act on 
climate change, a new global energy 
order is emerging - leading to a 
shift in the way energy is produced 
and consumed. This gradual move 
away from fossil fuels is prompting 
an increased focus on developing 
policies, incentives and regulatory 
frameworks that can bolster the 
adoption of low-carbon technologies 
and green products - which may 
impact the demand for RIL’s current 
products. Additionally, the envisaged 
development of a domestic carbon 
market regime and thereby the likely 
introduction of stricter regulations 
related to GHG emissions may impact 
RIL’s operating costs.

The high energy inflation could lead to headwinds for the global economy affecting oil demand and 
refining margins.
There was unforeseen market scenario with a disruption of energy sources and oil supply mainly in the western 
regions due to geo-political developments between neighbouring countries of Ukraine and Russia. This has 
resulted in a shift in sourcing of energy and oil from alternate destinations, which has led to change in the 
trade‑flows worldwide.
The resultant longer sea passage has created shortage of availability of tankers and thus historically high volatility in 
freight rates.
Further, the phased embargoes of Russian products that has come into place has created challenges which are likely 
to continue to be more complex for transportation of food and energy worldwide.

Risk Description
Data has undoubtedly become a key pillar in this digital economy where every interaction results in generation of 
massive datasets. This data is consumed and used by businesses for providing customised experiences, helping 
shape new business models and driving a customer-centric service environment in this competitive market. This 
also brings challenges to organisations in ethically handling such data. The rising number of data breaches is the 
greatest concern for organisations of every size and scale.
Due to the large-scale digitisation and expansion of B2C businesses, the handling of personal data of customers, 
consumers, employees, partners, and service providers transparently and securely becomes of utmost importance. 
Improper handling and inadequate data protection practices may lead to data breaches and non-compliance with

Reliance has adopted an approach of 
being proactive and at the same time 
being resilient to manage cyber risk. 
The Cyber Security strategy defined 
at Reliance is based on Mark to Threat 
and is aligned to business as well 
as technology.
Security by design principle and 
shift left strategy is followed across 
the lifecycle of the digital platforms 
to ensure that cyber security 
controls are part of the design. The 
cyber‑attack surface is continuously 
monitored to identify vulnerabilities 
or misconfigurations and identified 
weaknesses are fixed on priority.

Intelligence-driven Cyber Defense 
operations are performed for 
proactive threat detection. Rapid 
response playbooks are in place 
and updated regularly for cyber 
incident management.
Third-party risk management 
processes are in place to manage 
and minimise the impact of supply

At RIL, special attention is paid to 
Cyber Security awareness and to 
foster a culture of Cyber security 
as humans have turned out to be 
the best defenses to combat cyber 
threats. Innovative solutions such as 
R-phish are deployed to improve user 
awareness levels by tracking their 
Phishing Resistance Score levels.
Cybersecurity awareness month 
is observed every year with a 
context‑based campaign. The context 
for this year was “Fostering a culture

Risk Description
RIL has always been at the forefront of using cutting-edge technologies for bringing more efficiency into businesses. 
Digital transformation is thus an ongoing activity in Reliance. The pace of digital transformation has been increasing 
over the years. One of the consequences of such rapid digital transformation is the expansion of cyber-attack 
surfaces. Cybersecurity risk is thus emerging as one of the prominent business risks.
Cybercrime and Cyber Insecurity is considered as one of the severe global risks as per the World Economic Forum’s 
Global Risk Report 2023 making it clear that cyber risks will remain a constant and significant concern over the next 
decade. Cyber Attacks today are more sophisticated, persistent, and disruptive in nature. Geo-political influences are
